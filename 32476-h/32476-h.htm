<p><i>January.</i>&mdash;Now the weather is very cold. There are no leaves upon the
trees. The ground is frozen quite hard. Perhaps it is covered with snow.
Every thing looks very cold and comfortless. A little boy or girl, when
out of humor, reminds me of this month. Bring plenty of wood and make a
good fire, that we may warm ourselves.</p>

<p><i>February</i> is a cold month, but the days are getting longer. Now the
crocuses and snow-drops begin to appear. When little boys and girls have
been naughty, how pleasant it is to see them begin to be good again!
Remember, the crocuses and snow-drops do not make themselves grow: it is
God that causes them to grow. So we must look to him to enable us to be
good.</p>

<p><i>March.</i>&mdash;The wind blows very hard. Mind it does not blow you away. See,
that tree has been blown down. Job says that God is angry with the
wicked, and that they are as stubble before the wind. Do you recollect
that the winds and the sea obeyed Jesus, and were still when he bade
them? He can still our angry passions as easily as he did the winds and
waves.</p>

<p><i>April.</i>&mdash;The spring is come; the trees are in blossom; the leaves
begin to appear. The birds sing merrily, and every thing looks cheerful.
Now you may work in your gardens. Do you not like to see a garden neat
and free from weeds? It is very pleasant to see children free from bad
habits and naughty ways.</p>

<p><i>May.</i>&mdash;This is a very pleasant month: now there are a great many
flowers. Little girls are fond of swinging. I hope they will not disobey
their parents. Little boys and girls often get hurt when they are
disobedient to their parents. They forget that the Bible says, "Children
obey your parents."</p>

<p><i>June</i>.&mdash;Now it is time to cut the grass and make hay. It is very
pleasant to go and help. See how soon the grass withers after it is cut.
"In the morning it flourisheth and groweth up, in the evening it is cut
down and withereth." Little children often seem very well, but on a
sudden they are taken ill, and die;&mdash;they are compared to grass and
flowers.</p>

<p><i>July.</i>&mdash;It is very hot, and the animals retire to the shade. Now you
must water your garden: if you do not, your plants will die. Are you
fond of strawberries and currants? They are now ripe, but do not eat
them without leave.</p>

<p><i>August.</i>&mdash;The grain begins to ripen. Now the farmer sends his men with
their sickles, and they reap it; it is then tied up in sheaves and
carried to the barn. Do you recollect the parable about the wheat and
the tares? Matthew, 13. Christ compares those who love him to wheat:
they will go to heaven. The wicked are compared to tares: they are to be
punished.</p>

<p><i>September.</i>&mdash;It is time to gather the apples and pears. You may get a
basket, and pick up those that fall down. Christ said, "By their fruits
ye shall know them;" he then spoke of peoples actions. We know whether
little children are good or naughty, by what they do.</p>

life; the fruit of the wicked to sin.</blockquote>

<p><i>October.</i>&mdash;The leaves are falling off the trees. The days are now a
great deal shorter than they were. The grapes are ripe; it is time to
gather them. Christ compared himself to a vine, and his disciples to the
branches. Remember that it is to him we are to look for grace and
strength, to enable us to do what pleases him. The branches will not
bring forth fruit if they are parted from the vine.</p>

<p><i>November.</i>&mdash;Now the weather is dark and dismal; you must amuse yourself
in doors. When you are tired of playing, come and sit down and read a
little. Here is a pretty picture book to look at. It is about the
"Histories in the Bible." I do not know any picture book with half so
many pretty pictures as those which are taken from the Bible.</p>

<p><i>December.</i>&mdash;Now dreary winter reigns, and the year comes to its solemn
close. All the sins we have committed, this year against God, and all we
have done in obedience to his commands, are now written down in his
book. So our life will soon close; and we must then appear before God in
judgment, and render up our account for all the deeds done in the body,
whether they be good, or whether they be evil.</p>

<p>I dare say you have read in your Testament, that Christ came down from
heaven to save sinners, and that all have sinned. He has promised to
hear all who call upon him. We cannot be happy unless we love him. Our
hearts are inclined to evil by nature, so that we do not like to hear
about him, unless he causes us to love him. Pray, then, that he would,
by the power of his Holy Spirit, enable you to love and serve him in
early youth.</p>

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
